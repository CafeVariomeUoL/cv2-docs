# Data Discovery

>Discover the data with our powerful query engine. But....why data discovery?

Lack of data and costs of data generation was the major limiters for innovative biomedical research. However, huge amounts of data are generated daily using modern biotechnology methods in a vast array of settings, from primary/secondary health to biomedical researchers to personal health devices.

Therefore, existing biomedical datasets represent great value in re-use, merging for increased power and connecting different resources. This not only helps build on the data for cohort studies but is also useful in analysing patterns from various health sources.

Unfortunately, biomedical datasets are held in many organisations in many different formats (excel, SQL databases, proprietary software etc.,), with each organisation having their own rules, regulations, resources and requirements for storing and sharing datasets. This makes data difficult to access and utilise even when data owners are willing to share data.

At present, there is growing support for FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), but it is still difficult in practice, boiling down to data owners not being allowed (legal and consent restrictions) or unwilling or unable to share data due to technical, financial or manpower constraints.

Consequently, there is a growing interest in how data "discovery" might complement and promote data sharing. Data discovery involved a range of approaches designed to help the existence (rather than the substance) of data to be made apparent. 


## Data Discovery Purpose

In its simplest guise, data discovery can entail producing descriptive texts about datasets and making these texts openly and conveniently available. Online catalogues and collections of journal abstracts and articles are a few examples demonstrating that the data can be made **Findable**. More powerfully, descriptive texts can be enhanced with structured metadata, to contextualize and portray the data more fully (ex: LeHMR, HDR Gateway, Matchmaker Exchange etc.,).

The primary purpose of data discovery is to provide a more comprehensive overview of which data or what datasets exist that might be of value for any intended purpose, and second, to enable data owners to advertise their data without necessarily being obliged to release it too liberally until they are willing or able to do so. Data discovery systems may also seek to provide potential data consumers with sufficient insight into the nature of each dataset to be confident that it is worth investing effort to request and analyze the data.

Nevertheless, such systems can still leave considerable uncertainty over whether a discovered data set will be useful for any particular analysis. Descriptive texts and metadata may also simply not be available, for instance, in the case of DNA diagnostic test results in healthcare settings.

The ultimate solution, therefore, is to establish data discovery systems that leverage the data directly, without revealing the data explicitly. This can be achieved by creating search interfaces that allow the discovery of data presented graphically, or which interrogate (but do not necessarily display) merely a core set of "safe" data fields or data organised into summary form. Formally, these approaches do convey some "information" from the data and so must legally be considered to be a narrow form of data sharing. But by design, they create very little opportunity for data abuse, and this can be further minimized by controlling who can undertake discovery searches, and by the use of record-count thresholds below which no discovery hit is reported. 

**Cafe Variome is one such data discovery tool, which is completely flexible to datatypes using its agnostic model, utilising advanced graph-based technologies to take advantage of the semantic similarity and ontology mapping standards.**

We make it as easy as we can for both the data owner and the user to move forward in the data discovery domain. Cafe Variome is currently being used as a solution for many health data discovery systems as highlighted in our Exemplars section. Cafe Variome's niche is the discovery of data related to rare diseases.

In further sections, we drill down into how Cafe Variome can be useful for [](data-owners.md) and [](researchers.md).
