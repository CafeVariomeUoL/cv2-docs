# Quick Start

`Post-installation steps to setup Caf√© Variome.`


## Prerequisites
After successful installation of Cafe Variome, you will be shown the following info:

`Setup completed. Remember that you must remove the Install directory completely. `

Please remove the /Install directory that came with the software package as it is no longer needed.

You can now navigate to the base URL that was set during installation (ex: http://localhost/dummy_cv) in the choice of your browser. This takes you to the landing page of Cafe Variome, as shown below:
