`Technology Stack for Cafe Variome`

## Overview
Cafe Variome is written in PHP and uses the **CodeIgniter Framework** to run in an MVC (Model, View, Controller) context. MySQL is being used as the primary database, but can also be adapted to your requirements (ex: PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Triple Stores etc.,). To index data from the database, Elasticsearch is used. Optionally, if you want to benefit from discovery based on semantic similarity, Neo4J is required to store ontology structures.
